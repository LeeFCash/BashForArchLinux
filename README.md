# BashForArchLinux
This is for people who want some bash to help them with things like bluetooth, auto shutdown if not at pc and more that is made for arch linux but may work for other linux distributions but you may have some problems.

(if bash uses something you don't have installed then it may not work)
(for some bash's you will need to change the bash for your need/want)
